Q10and Q15 are subjective answer type questions, Answer them in your own words briefly.
10. What is the difference between a boxplot and histogram?
Histograms and box plots are very similar in that they both help to visualize and describe numeric data. 
Although histograms are better in determining the underlying distribution of the data, 
box plots allow you to compare multiple data sets better than histograms as they are less detailed and take up less space.

11. How to select metrics?
The type of metric to use depends on the statistical nature of the problem at hand, the distribution to which the features belong, and the type of feature we are dealing with.

12. How do you assess the statistical significance of an insight?
To assess statistical significance, you would use hypothesis testing. 
The null hypothesis and alternate hypothesis would be stated first. 
Second, you’d calculate the p-value, which is the likelihood of getting the test’s observed findings if the null hypothesis is true. 
Finally, you would select the threshold of significance (alpha) and reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is smaller than the alpha — in other words, the result is statistically significant.

13. Give examples of data that doesnot have a Gaussian distribution, nor log-normal.
Allocation of wealth among individuals
Values of oil reserves among oil fields (many small ones, a small number of large ones)

14. Give an example where the median is a better measure than the mean.
The mean is used for normal distributions. 
The median is generally used for skewed distributions. 
The mean is not a robust tool since it is largely influenced by outliers. 
The median is better suited for skewed distributions to derive at central tendency since it is much more robust and sensible.

15. What is the Likelihood
The likelihood is the probability that a particular outcome is observed when the true value of the parameter is , equivalent to the probability mass on
